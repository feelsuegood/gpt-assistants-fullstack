      "Now, let’s dive into what makes these scents so perfect for summer.  \n",
      "- **Citrus & Fruits:** Think lemon, bergamot, orange—bright, refreshing, and instantly mood-boosting. They give your skin an instant cool feeling.  \n",
      "- **Aquatic & Marine Notes:** Remember the ocean breeze? These notes mimic the seaside, creating a clean, breezy vibe that’s perfect for daytime wear.  \n",

      "- **Go Light & Fresh:** Opt for scents with citrus, aquatic, or green notes for daytime.  \n",
      "- **Layer Smart:** Use body lotions or mists from the same fragrance line to make your scent last longer.  \n",
      "- **Apply Correctly:** Spray on pulse points—wrists, behind the ears, and neck—and don’t overdo it; lighter sprays are better because heat amplifies scent.  \n",
      "- **Test in the Heat:** Always try out new scents in warm weather before committing—what smells great in winter can feel different when it’s hot outside.  \n",
