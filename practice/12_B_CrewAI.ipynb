The game’s protagonist, known as the Destined One—an incarnation and successor of Sun Wukong—embarks on a quest to recover these relics to revive Wukong's consciousness.

Spells and transformations further diversify combat, offering shapeshifting abilities and unique skills, along with spirit and vessel systems that empower passive and active bonuses. The progression is mostly linear but features expansive areas, checkpoints, and a character skill reallocation system for flexible playstyles.
